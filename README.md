# azureManagementGroups

## Problem
You want to create a Management Group Heirarchy but you want a custom heirarchy or you have LOTS of management groups to create. You may also have LOTS of subscriptions to move into your new Management Group structure.

## Solution
Create a simple CSV file defining your heirarchy and subscription assignments. Then run Deploy-ManagemenGroups.ps1
